# ML-Driven Hybrid Quantitative Trading Strategy üöÄ

## Overview
This project develops a **hybrid quantitative trading strategy** that integrates **technical indicators, risk management, and economic event-based analysis**. The strategy dynamically adapts to market conditions by optimizing **buy/sell signals** based on historical **Sharpe Ratio** and **Win/Loss Ratio**. 

Instead of using fixed signals, each function returns a **probability score** in the range **[0,1]**, which is optimized dynamically. The final decision is based on an adaptive threshold.

- **-1 (Sell):** Strong bearish signal  
- **0 (Hold):** Neutral or uncertain market condition  
- **+1 (Buy):** Strong bullish signal  

---

## üìä Machine Learning Integration
We incorporate **Machine Learning (ML) techniques** to optimize trading signals and improve decision-making. Our model includes:

- **Adaptive Probability Scaling:** Instead of discrete signals, each trading component returns a probability score optimized dynamically.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting market indicators (volatility, macroeconomic trends) for better predictive capabilities.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Utilizing **Bayesian Optimization** and **Grid Search** to fine-tune probability scaling parameters and decision thresholds.
- **Risk Management Models:** Detecting market anomalies using **statistical outlier detection** and **volatility-based risk modeling**.

## üìå Data Sources
We collect financial data from sources like **FactSet and Yahoo Finance**, including:

- **Stock Price Data:** Open, close, high, low prices aggregated **weekly** and **monthly**.
- **Economic Event Data:** Interest rates (Fed), employment rate, CPI, GDP (announced yearly).
- **Market Risk Metrics:** VaR (Value at Risk), ATR (Average True Range), extreme outlier detection.

## üìà Trading Strategies
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Probability-Based Technical Trading Strategy**
Instead of fixed signals, we estimate the probability of **bullish** or **bearish** market conditions.

$$ P_{MA} = \sigma(\lambda_{MA} (Short_{MA} - Long_{MA})) $$

$$ P_{Risk} = \sigma(\lambda_{Risk} (VaR - ATR) + Outlier_{score}) $$

Where:
$$ \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $$ is the **sigmoid activation function**.
- \( \lambda_{MA}, \lambda_{Risk} \) are **adaptive probability scaling parameters**, optimized dynamically.

**Final Technical Signal:**

$$ f_{technical} = w_1 \cdot P_{MA} + w_2 \cdot P_{Risk} $$

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Probability-Based Hybrid Trading Strategy**
We extend **Technical Analysis** by integrating **Macroeconomic Events** to refine trading decisions.

$$ P_{Econ} = \sigma(\lambda_{Econ} (GDP - Interest_{Rate})) $$

**Final Hybrid Signal:**

$$ f_{hybrid} = w_1 \cdot P_{MA} + w_2 \cdot P_{Risk} + w_3 \cdot P_{Econ} $$

The final trading decision follows:

- \( f < -T_{adaptive} \) ‚Üí **Sell (-1)**
- \( -T_{adaptive} \leq f \leq T_{adaptive} \) ‚Üí **Hold (0)**
- \( f > T_{adaptive} \) ‚Üí **Buy (+1)**

Where **\( T_{adaptive} \)** is a **dynamically optimized threshold**.

## üèÜ Backtesting & Adaptive Threshold Optimization
All probability outputs are compared to **adaptive thresholds \( T_{adaptive} \)**, which are optimized based on **Sharpe Ratio and Win/Loss Ratio**.

$$ T_{adaptive} = \arg\max_T Sharpe(T) + Win/Loss(T) $$

Backtesting is conducted over **multiple timeframes** to ensure robust optimization:

- **Short-term (6 months - 1 year):** Evaluates recent trends.
- **Mid-term (5 years):** Tests performance across different market cycles.
- **Long-term (10 years):** Ensures stability under varying economic conditions.

---

## üîß Optimization Methods
We optimize both **probability scaling parameters (\(\lambda\))** and **decision thresholds** to ensure stability across different market conditions.

- **Bayesian Optimization:** Finds the most stable probability thresholds and \(\lambda\) values across multiple timeframes.
- **Grid Search:** Ensures robustness by systematically testing different threshold and \(\lambda\) ranges.
- **Timeframe-Aware Optimization:** We compare optimized \(\lambda\) values across different timeframes and select the most stable configuration that maximizes **Sharpe Ratio and Win/Loss Ratio**.

## üöÄ Implementation Details
- **Programming Languages:** Python and R
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Optimization Techniques:** Bayesian Optimization, Grid Search, Sharpe Ratio maximization
- **Deployment:** Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation.
